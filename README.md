# Projet_HMMA307
## About:
This is the repository for the HMMA307 course in advanced linear models. This part deals with the Quantile Regression.

### Numerical part:

- Ryma implemented the median regression by the CVXPY package
- Yani compared between median regression and Ridge regression
- Lo√Øc took care of reproducing Figures 1.6 and 1.7 from [Koenker's book](https://mail.umontpellier.fr/service/home/~/?auth=co&loc=fr&id=16090&part=2)

### Beamer: 

Our group wrote the end of CM6 (Random Anova) and CM7 (Quantile Regression).
For the drafting of lesson number 7, we proceeded as follows:
- Loic took care of the variance estimator part
- Yani of the Maximum Likelihood part
- Ryma of Quantile Regression( Beamer + images )
